		<h2 class="title">ABOUT US</h2>
      
		<p>In 2017, Marshall Lewis entered the woodworking scene when he inherited his first hand saw and planer from his grandfather. With those two tools, some scrap wood, and a bit of creativity, he made his very first garden chair to sit on his home&#39;s empty deck. Not too long after, he was building additional chairs, benches, tables, and planters for various locations around his home's exterior. As his vision and passion grew, he found the space in his garage quickly filling with furniture that did not have places in his yard. In order to continue building and refining his work, he gave his chairs and benches away to family and friends. It did not take long before neighbors, friends of friends, and extended family found themselves enjoying those chairs and benches, and requests to purchase his work followed shortly after. In 2018, after completing a handful of commissions, Lewis Wood Forge was founded and has been creating beautiful, high quality, handcrafted outdoor wood furniture ever since.</p>
